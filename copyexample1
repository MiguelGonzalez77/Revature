This will override the changes made to copyexample2

EDIT: now it is overridden and now doesn't show currently the initial change.

EDIT2: With the -b flag on, now it created a backup of copyexample1

EDIT3: Now with the -f flag on, this will force to copy into the destination
file, and it should delete copyexample2

EDIT4: Using -p flag will preserve characteristics such as ownership, file
permissions, last access, etc. from the source file In case if I ran a chmod or some other permissions on the file I am copying into.
